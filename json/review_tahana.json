Not having had one for a long time, I ordered a Jack Daniels Old Fashioned.  I think what I got was some kind of whiskey sour.  No bitters in it, no fruit and very small.  They brought a small personal scorpion bowl for the other two adults (who had ordered a scorpion bowl for two). So upon request they brought a second one.  It was not made the same as the first one and neither was that satisfactory."

# Restaurant Review Frontend

This is a restaurant review web application with a focus on accessibility. It remotely accesses JSON files containing restaurant information as well as JSON files containing review information for each restaurant. It can filter restaurant list by the keyword of the description, the type of food, price range, and/or rating of restaurant.

AngularJS2 (rc1) is used for the project.

It is developed under Version 53.0.2769.0 canary (64-bit) canary (64-bit).

## Usage

* `npm install` (to install required node packages.)
* `npm run start` (it concurrently runs lite-server and gulp default. gulp default watches modification of dev files, if something is modified, compile those.)
